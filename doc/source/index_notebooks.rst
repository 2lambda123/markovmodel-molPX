   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Example Notebook
==================
You can find this notebook in the ``molpx/notebooks/`` directory and execute it yourself.

Unfortunately for this html documentation, ``nglview``â€˜s output, i.e. the pictures of molecular structures,
`cannot be stored currently in the notebook file
<https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets/issues/754#issuecomment-267814374>`_. In short: this html-notebook is lacking the most visually appealing part of molpx. Please check the :doc:`Youtube video </about>`  or the :doc:`gif animation </index>` to see ``molpx`` in action.
