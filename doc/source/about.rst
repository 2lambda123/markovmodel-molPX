About
=========

`projX` has been developed mostly by `Dr. Guillermo Pérez-Hernández <http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/
comp-mol-bio/staff/perez/index.html>`_
in the group of `Prof. Dr. Frank Noé <http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/comp-mol-bio/index.html>`_, with
occasional but priceless help from:
  * `Martin K. Scherer <https://github.com/marscher>`_
  * `Moritz Hoffman <https://github.com/clonker>`_
  * `Fabian Paul <https://github.com/fabian-paul>`_, and
  * `Dr. Simon Olsson <https://github.com/psolsson>`_

Beyond `projX`'s own methods, this module connects two incredibly powerful and incredibly useful python modules:
  * `mdtraj <http://mdtraj.org/>`_ for handling molecular structures inside python
  * `nglview IPython/Jupyter widget <https://github.com/arose/nglview>`_ for in-notebook molecular visualization.


`projX` is specially in debt to `Dr. Alexander Rose
<https://github.com/arose>`_, who, apart from developing the impressive `nglview
<https://github.com/arose/nglview>`_ (among other projects) provided the very first proof-of-concept for `projX`.

`projX` was recently introduced to the community in a `PyEMMA <https://pyemma.org>`_ workshop in Berlin:
