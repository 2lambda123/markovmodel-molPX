# projection_explorer by gph82.
ipython API to visualize MD-trajectories interactively on any projection space.

The API is projX, which provides access to projX.generate and projX.visualize

The notebook Projection_Explorer explains the general cases, 
but you can combine the methods freely.


WARNINGS:
- Most of the methods in bmutils have not been properly tested (yet)
- This is currently under heavy development and the API might change rapidly

INSTALL:
python setup.py install
(conda installation will follow)

KNOWN ISSUES:
- installation of nglview might give a "Sandbox" error. Recommended install 
is then to externally use "conda install nglview -c bioconda"


Have FUN!
